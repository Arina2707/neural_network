# Tool for ANFIS fuzzy-neural network usage for evaluation of laser companies overall performance.

This is the fifth part of **5-stage project**, connected with scoring the companies in laser industry.

Other parts of project:
- https://github.com/jularina/CompetitorsAmpl1
- https://github.com/jularina/CompetitorsAmpl2
- https://github.com/jularina/CompetitorsAmpl3
- https://github.com/jularina/CompetitorsAmpl4

Here the main accent is on providing the structure of ANFIS Net for evaluation overall score of suppliers.
As inputs - the scores from the Bayes Nets are used (formed in https://github.com/jularina/CompetitorsAmpl4).
Fuzzy sugeno inference is used to proceed results.

The overall structure of the project is provided in Pic.1. The ANFIS stage is shown with red rectangle.
